# Dividend App

## Introduction
This project is created for the Software Project course at Haaga-Helia. This frontend React app analyzes the share and dividend of some Finnish company.

## Experience with Git 
I have worked with Git for a while already so everything has been great so far!

I have created another branch "features" and tested the main branch protection in Github. At the moment, the repo requires a pull request and a review from Code Owners before merging.
